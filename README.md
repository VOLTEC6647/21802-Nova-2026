🤖 FTC Team 21802: Nova - 2026 Robot Code
This repository contains the Java source code for the FIRST Tech Challenge 2025-2026 season robot. Our code uses a modern command-based framework and implements advanced motion control and navigation systems.

✨ Key Features
Our codebase is built on a robust architecture designed for precision, reliability, and ease of development.

Software Architecture

FTCLib (Command-Based): Utilizes the FTCLib library for organized programming with commands and subsystems.

FTC Dashboard: Allows real-time tuning of constants (PID/PIDF) and telemetry visualization via a web browser.

Advanced Navigation

Pedro Pathing: Implements the library for smooth and precise autonomous movement with trajectory planning and advanced path following.

Fused Localization: Uses the GoBilda Pinpoint Driver for odometry, combined with IMU for accurate robot position estimation.

Mechanism Control

Limelight Vision: Integration of the Limelight 3A camera for tag localization (AprilTags) and vision-assisted targeting.
